# Fake-News-Detector
Fake News Detector is a Machine learning project.


Introduction

Fake news is a growing problem in the digital world, spreading misinformation that can influence public perception, politics, and decision-making. This Fake News Detector is a Machine Learning (ML) project that classifies news articles as real or fake based on their content.

This project is part of my college coursework and serves as a practical application of Machine Learning and Python. It enhances my understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP), text classification, model evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.


Features

Dataset Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares news data for training.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and word embeddings.

Machine Learning Models: Implements classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and Random Forest to detect fake news.

Model Evaluation: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for assessment.

Deployment with Streamlit: Provides a simple and interactive web interface for users to test news articles.


Tech Stack

Python: Core programming language

Scikit-Learn: Machine learning algorithms

NLTK & SpaCy: Text preprocessing and NLP

Pandas & NumPy: Data handling and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

Streamlit: Web-based deployment for an interactive UI


Why This Project?

Strengthens my skills in Machine Learning, NLP, and Python.

Provides hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.

Deploys the ML model using Streamlit, making it accessible to users.
